# Welcome to The HyperText Translation Portal!
This is the code hub for The HyperText Translation Portal (2024), a multimedia performance art piece by Miya Sheker. The performance stages an encounter between the artist's original poetry and poetry written by the artist with the assistance of Python code that generates lines of poetry. Including live performance, a static video, and live code interacting with the environment, this GitHub is dedicated to the live code that plays during the performance. 

## The Encounter
If you are interested in the project that generated lines of poetry, please go to this [GitHub gist page](https://gist.github.com/mxshek/7ed2cde194c7ca578393973774ed894f). 

## The Code
The code creates multiple screens that are timed using framecounts to correlate with the static video. It includes a mix of sound interactive screens and playing videos.
